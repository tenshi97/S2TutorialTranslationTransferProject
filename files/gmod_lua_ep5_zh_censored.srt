00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,040
Localplayer and as you can see on the
Localplayer，然后你可以看到

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,240
global there's a function here called
在global底下有个函数

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,710
Localplayer now you know it's it's
叫LocalPlayer()，注意到

35
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,210
orange which means you can only run on
这个函数是橙色的，意味着你只能在

36
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,490
the client and the description says that
客户端执行这个函数，描述中说这个函数

37
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,200
it returns to place object of the

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,030
current client localplayer will return

important it returns to players object
这个函数能返回玩家对象

43
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:39,020
yet the player object of the current
yes,执行函数的客户端对应的玩家对象

44
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,450
client so what that means is it will

45
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,570
return the player object itself in the
它能够返回游戏世界里的

46
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:45,950
physical world and then we can do

00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,149
whatever we want to it so what we're
对玩家做出一系列我们想做的操作，我们现在

48
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:48,890
gonna do is I'm gonna make a local
创建一个本地变量

49
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,750
variable call it ply and I'm gonna set
叫做ply，令它等于

50
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,180
it equal to Localplayer() and I'm gonna
LocalPlayer()

51
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,740
call that and I do have to call it as a
注意后面要加上()，因为这是唤起一个函数

52
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,390
function let me go ahead and change this
注意把GMOD

53
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,850
to GMOD there we go I do have to set
语法高亮打开

54
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,770
as a function because that's what it is
(再次废话一下这个是函数，要加())

55
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,439
and now the variable PR y then source of
现在ply就成了

56
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,780
reference to this so just a just a
对玩家的一个引用

57
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,490
double check I'm gonna do lua_

58
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,220
whoops lua_openscript_cl
哦,lua_openscript_cl

59
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,530
now you're gonna want to make
注意了请确保你

60
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,960
sure that you run this on the client
是在客户端运行的(要加_cl)

61
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,820
because local player will not work on
因为localplayer()这个函数

62
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,290
the server as we've seen it's a client
不能再服务端执行，我们之前看到了它是个

63
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,060
only function so when we run this as you
只能在客户端运行的函数，接着我们运行

64
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,580
can see we've got no errors so things

65
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,370
are good
这很好

66
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,019

搜索player:,哦，是player

69
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,659

74
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,540
and orange which means it can be used on
标记为蓝色和橙色，意味着

75
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,150
both client and server now it checks if

82
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,799
call it isPlayerAlive now the way
isPlayerAlive，我们唤起

83
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:06,959

这个函数的方式

84
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,519
exactly what they look like here player
就像wiki上写的那样，把冒号前的

85
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:09,930
would be our reference to the player
Player，换成你想要检测的玩家的引用

86
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,239
then we do : and we call the function on

87
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,579
the player so in this case we can do

104
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,419
there is many many many things we can do

00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:53,250
and in case you didn't notice at the
别忘了wiki上

106
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,819
wiki there is a lot of things here so
还有好多东西呢

107
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,459
let's go ahead and look at a few other
我们继续去看一看其他的函数吧

108
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,410
one so now the one set of blue for
比如这个蓝色的

109
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:05,040
example kill kill can only be called as
kill函数，kill函数只能被

110
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,769
it says here can only be called because
就像这蓝色表明的，它只能

111
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:09,720
it's blue on the server which means that
被服务端唤起，这意味着

112
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,930
on the client you cannot kill anybody
在客户端，你不能强制处似任何人

113
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,549
from the client you can ask the server

114
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:16,949
to kill people but we'll get into that
去处似某人，不过这个机制我们会在

115
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:19,199
on another date so let's go ahead and
之后的节目里讲到，现在我们要做的是

116
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,539
take a look at some more some of these
让我们继续看看其他的

117
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:24,690
being like the orange one we can take a
带橙色的函数，比如

118
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,010
look at is speaking
这个IsSpeaking函数

119
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,040
and that is gonna return true or false of
它会返回一个true或false的boolean

120
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,910
whether the play was speaking we got set
表示这个玩家是否在开麦克风

121
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,350
muted which would mute a never player on
我们再看看这个setmuted函数，这个函数能在服务端上

122
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,710
the server so as long as you had this
让特定玩家封麦，只要你有...

123
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,240
would be the the other play on the
呃，也可以让其他玩家封麦，只要你有

124
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,340
server then you could have a reference
那个玩家对象的引用就行

125
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,110
to them set them to meet it and set to
然后你就可以对他执行setmute函数，并

126
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,930
meet it to true but yeah we're gonna go
传递一个true参数，我们接着看看

127
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,610
ahead and take a look at frags
Frags这个函数

128
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,160
so basically frags is kills and as you
基本上来说frags就是打敌数，正如你看到的

129
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,950
can see my frags right now is going to
我的frags应该是

130
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,870
be zero because on the scoreboard wait
0，因为计分板上。。。等等

131
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,790
my frag is negative one actually because
我的frag是-1，因为我

132
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,890
I killed myself but we'll go ahead and
刚刚击败自己了一次，我们继续

133
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,440
we'll store frags in there instead of
我们把frags存储在这里，然后

134
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,530
we'll just name this two kills and let's
把变量命名为kills,然后

135
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,810
go ahead and simply print that out now
继续把这个变量打印出来

136
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,030
let's go ahead and run our script and as
然后我们执行这个脚本

137
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,440
you can see it prints out negative one
你可以看到打印的结果是-1

138
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,470
but let's say I go to the NPC section
我们打开NPC选项卡

139
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,160
here and I just couldn't go to a weapon
然后我们切到武器选项卡

140
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,930
and grab something now all of these are
拿一把武器，然后我们把这些

141
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,510
obviously account if it kills and as you
NPC都图了，然后你可以看到

142
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,510
can see oops on the scoreboard I oh I
计分板上，哦不

143
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,380
guess not
我想的不对

144
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,750
I thought that the NPC's Count as kills
我以为击打NPC能够增加击打数

145
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,510
but clearly not so I'm still gonna be on
但显然不是这样，所以我还是

146
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,490
negative one but what we can do is we
\-1分，不过我们还可以

147
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,190
can also get my deaths now I know this
获取我的似亡数，我知道这看起来

148
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,630
may seem a bit repetitive but I'm just
有点无聊，但我还是

149
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,980
trying to make sure that you understand
