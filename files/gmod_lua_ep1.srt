00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,590
hello everybody and welcome to part 1 in

2
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,890
the gmod Lewis fluorosis now in this

3
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:17,910
video we're not gonna be doing any

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,740
coding we're just gonna be going over

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,380
the basics of what client and set-aside

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,119
is because they're two very important

7
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,610
things to know before you you actually

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,740
start coding for Garry's Mod now even if

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,240
you want a code in single-player it's

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,790
still vital you know this information

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,870
because believe it or not there is still

12
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,690
a client and a server relationship when

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,850
you're in a single-player game so we'll

14
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,470
go ahead and I'll open up Photoshop and

15
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,010
try my best to explain this so imagine

16
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,890
that this here so the way how server and

17
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,899
client are represented with orange and

18
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,899
blue so this circle here this is the

19
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,340
server ok now the server is what handles

20
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,289
pretty much every every aspect of

21
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,160
gameplay in a server such as when a

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,920
player should die dealing damage to a

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,650
player update in all of the other

24
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,960
clients on changes and stuff along this

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,680
line so this is us ok we are this circle

26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,170
down here and here is our link to the

27
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,189
server now us as the clients can't do

28
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:28,020
much in terms of controlling the game as

29
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,540
like I said it's already it's the server

30
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,710
that controls now multiple clients can

31
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,729
be connected to the same server and

32
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:40,640
let's say

33
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,320
you let's go ahead and just quickly

34
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,640
finish my amazing drawing now this is me

35
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,610
okay this one here now I move slightly

36
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,460
left so on my screen I move a little

37
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,890
left then information is carried across

38
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,259
this connection to the server the server

39
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:59,720
handles this information moves my player

40
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,940
in the service world and then the server

41
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,070
then goes and updates everybody else on

42
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,840
my new position where I move to now with

43
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,399
certain things that can only be done on

44
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,190
the server and there are certain things

45
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,350
that can only be done on the client okay

46
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,510
now there is a little bit in the middle

47
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,120
called shared which is where things can

48
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,820
be done on both client and server but

49
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,130
mainly you're going to be working in

50
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,920
server to do the majority of the logic

51
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,840
of your programs now when we first up

52
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,040
we're going to be starting in the client

53
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,780
and writing some basic client-side

54
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,459
scripts and once we start to get the

55
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:36,080
gist of that but I'm going to move over

56
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,360
into the server and once we start to

57
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,280
understand how the server works we're

58
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,720
then going to go ahead and we are going

59
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,810
to work on both of them so we'll find

60
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,280
out how to communicate between those

61
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,060
with your scripts

62
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,340
and how to make something that works

63
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,340
with both people such as say you wanted

64
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,989
to send a message from this player over

65
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:56,000
to this player how could we do that in

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,950
doer and things along that line so I

67
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,410
know this video was short it's just the

68
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,019
basic introductory of you know we're

69
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:04,250
going to be going now I do want to also

70
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,380
say that if you have not already seen my

71
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,120
Lua tutorial series and you're not

72
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,820
familiar with Lua at all I recommend you

73
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,170
watch that series there will be a link

74
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,850
in the description if you have finished

75
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,290
a series and you're moving on in the

76
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,720
next video we'll be getting into some

77
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,049
coding hopefully some basic scripts but

78
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:23,780
yeah I hope you understand what I've got

79
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,640
if you don't feel free to leave a

80
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,400
comment and I will get back to you and

81
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,360
thanks for watching see you in the next

82
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,540
video

83
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,319
you
