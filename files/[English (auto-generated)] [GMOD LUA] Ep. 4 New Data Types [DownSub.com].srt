00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:13,809
hello everybody and welcome to our for

2
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:16,599
industry market or series now in this

3
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:18,039
video again we're not gonna be going too

4
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:19,779
much into scripting and I do apologize

5
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:21,730
for guys who want to really get into the

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,009
more advanced stuff but I just need to

7
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:25,239
make sure that people who are new

8
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:27,630
understand the these fundamental things

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,460
so in this video I'm gonna explain some

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,439
things about data types now we're in in

11
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,210
my lure tutorial series if you've ever

12
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,160
watched it we went over some data types

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,050
and some of those were pools numbers

14
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,790
strings you know there was a few data

15
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,030
types like their tables now in Garry's

16
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,589
Mod we're gonna be using more of these

17
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,900
and some of these will include player

18
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,920
data types entity data types let's go

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,960
over some more meta data or meta tables

20
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,720
as well that's just a few there will be

21
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,939
a lot more um so what I'm gonna do here

22
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,438
is I'm gonna go ahead and bring up the

23
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:14,350
wiki for Garry's Mod now on the wiki if

24
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,500
you go to classes here you can see all

25
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,390
of the different basically data types or

26
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,620
classes that we're gonna be working with

27
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,480
and you can see player is one of them

28
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,900
now I don't expect you to be using all

29
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,700
of these but fundamental ones like

30
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,010
player and entities are ones that we're

31
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,640
gonna be using so when when I'm storing

32
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,590
something in a variable like if I did

33
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,060
something like test is equal to local

34
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,290
play which again doesn't make sense to

35
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,570
you now but well soon you may be

36
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,280
wondering well what this test hold does

37
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,570
it hold the number does it hold the

38
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,760
string does it hold the pool well no it

39
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,080
holds the metadata for the player now as

40
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,300
I said there is a few of these we will

41
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,270
be going over them and yeah so I just

42
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,799
wanted to make sure that you understand

43
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,770
that when I refer to playa de Ayer or

44
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,200
NPC Day or anything like that that's

45
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,549
what we're gonna be referring to again I

46
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:06,190
apologize a short video but in the next

47
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,080
one we should actually be getting

48
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,840
started on some code in and running some

49
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,430
functions so I hope you enjoyed the

50
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,080
video I hope you learned something and

51
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,150
I'll see you in the next video thanks

52
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,330
for watching

53
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,730
