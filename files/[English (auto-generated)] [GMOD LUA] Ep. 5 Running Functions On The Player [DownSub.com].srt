00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,920
hello everybody and welcome to part five

2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,780
in this gym I'll do a tutorial series

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,330
now before we get started I do want to

4
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,340
apologize for the lack of videos I have

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,860
not been feeling too well my mixer broke

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,630
meaning of my mic quality was just

7
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,570
appalling and again I really really

8
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,849
apologize for it but nevertheless let's

9
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:30,500
get started so in this video we're gonna

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,659
be taking a look at running functions on

11
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,310
the player which is important for two

12
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,840
reasons one is because we need to

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,300
understand how we can execute Mehta

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,149
functions on different data types but on

15
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:42,829
top of that we also need to understand

16
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:44,899
how we can get references to players in

17
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:47,179
different situations so what we're gonna

18
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:49,699
do we're gonna stop a single player

19
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:51,410
world if you have not done so already I

20
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,570
recommend you do so now then what we're

21
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,160
gonna do is we're gonna open up sublime

22
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,260
and that Lua file that is in our Garry's

23
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,210
Mod directory if you guys remember it

24
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,210
from the previous video I think so

25
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,140
anyway we're gonna go ahead we're gonna

26
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,670
get rid of that and we're gonna get

27
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,210
started so if you remember before well

28
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,620
actually we're get started first how do

29
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,750
we get a reference to the player so I'm

30
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,970
gonna open up the gmod wiki and I'm

31
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,220
gonna go ahead and search local whoops

32
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,040
local player and as you can see on the

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,240
global there's a function here called

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,710
local player now you know it's it's

35
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,210
orange which means you can only run on

36
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,490
the client and the description says that

37
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,200
it returns to place object of the

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,030
current client local player will return

39
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,560
no until all entities have been

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,570
initialized so this part we don't need

41
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,430
to worry about for now but this part is

42
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,729
important it returns to players object

43
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:39,020
yet the player object of the current

44
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,450
client so what that means is it will

45
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,570
return the player object itself in the

46
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:45,950
physical world and then we can do

47
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,149
whatever we want to it so what we're

48
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:48,890
gonna do is I'm gonna make a local

49
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,750
variable call it PRI and I'm gonna set

50
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,180
it equal to local player and I'm gonna

51
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,740
call that and I do have to call it as a

52
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,390
function let me go ahead and change this

53
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,850
to G mother there we go I do have to set

54
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,770
as a function because that's what it is

55
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,439
and now the variable PR y then source of

56
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,780
reference to this so just a just a

57
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,490
double check I'm gonna do lua underscore

58
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,220
whoops newer underscore open script and

59
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,530
score CL now you're gonna want to make

60
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,960
sure that you run this on the client

61
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,820
because local player will not work on

62
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,290
the server as we've seen it's a client

63
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,060
only function so when we run this as you

64
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,580
can see we've got no errors so things

65
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,370
are good

66
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,019
what can we do with this well let's go

67
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,760
ahead and go back to the gmod wiki and

68
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,379
search player if you search whoopsie

69
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,659
player right and then we're gonna go

70
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:38,069
into the classes section here and you'll

71
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:40,560
see all of these player : and then a ton

72
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,810
of these functions right so let's go

73
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,230
have a look at alive now this is blue

74
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,540
and orange which means it can be used on

75
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,150
both client and server now it checks if

76
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,650
the player is alive and will return a

77
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,239
boolean which is true or false of

78
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,829
whether the player is alive or not so

79
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:57,569
now let's say we go back in here we're

80
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:00,209
gonna go ahead and print well first of

81
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:01,440
all we're gonna make available I'm gonna

82
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,799
call it is a player alive now the way

83
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:06,959
how we call these functions is kind of

84
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,519
exactly what they look like here player

85
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:09,930
would be our reference to the player

86
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,239
then we do : and we call the function on

87
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,579
the player so in this case we can do PR

88
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:18,569
y : alive now remember that PR y is our

89
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:21,870
reference to our local player and what

90
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,920
we're gonna do is we're gonna check if

91
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,390
it's alive we're gonna store the value

92
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,250
that it returns inside of this is player

93
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:26,790
alive

94
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,989
and we're simply gonna go ahead and

95
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:30,930
we're gonna print out is player alive I

96
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,880
do apologize for that couch in let me

97
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,769
zoom out a bit hey guys so now if I go

98
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:37,160
back into my game and I run the script

99
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,870
as you can see it prints out true but if

100
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,730
I go ahead and kill myself and I rerun

101
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,349
that's good it now prints out false

102
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:45,900
because I am no longer alive so I hope

103
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,840
you understand that but on top of that

104
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,419
there is many many many things we can do

105
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:53,250
and in case you didn't notice at the

106
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,819
wiki there is a lot of things here so

107
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,459
let's go ahead and look at a few other

108
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,410
one so now the one set of blue for

109
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:05,040
example kill kill can only be called as

110
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,769
it says here can only be called because

111
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:09,720
it's blue on the server which means that

112
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,930
on the client you cannot kill anybody

113
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,549
from the client you can ask the server

114
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:16,949
to kill people but we'll get into that

115
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:19,199
on another date so let's go ahead and

116
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,539
take a look at some more some of these

117
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:24,690
being like the orange one we can take a

118
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,010
look at is speaking

119
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,040
and that is gonna return to a fault of

120
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,910
whether the play was speaking we got set

121
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,350
muted which would mute a never player on

122
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,710
the server so as long as you had this

123
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,240
would be the the other play on the

124
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,340
server then you could have a reference

125
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,110
to them set them to meet it and set to

126
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,930
meet it to true but yeah we're gonna go

127
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,610
ahead and take a look at Frank's

128
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,160
so basically frags is kills and as you

129
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,950
can see my Frank's right now is going to

130
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,870
be zero because on the scoreboard wait

131
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,790
my fact is negative one actually because

132
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,890
I killed myself but we'll go ahead and

133
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,440
we'll store frags in there instead of

134
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,530
we'll just name this two kills and let's

135
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,810
go ahead and simply print that out now

136
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,030
let's go ahead and run our script and as

137
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,440
you can see it prints out negative one

138
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,470
but let's say I go to the NPC section

139
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,160
here and I just couldn't go to a weapon

140
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,930
and grab something now all of these are

141
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,510
obviously account if it kills and as you

142
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,510
can see oops on the scoreboard I oh I

143
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,380
guess not

144
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,750
I thought that the NPC's Candida skills

145
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,510
but clearly not so I'm still gonna be on

146
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,490
negative one but what we can do is we

147
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,190
can also get my deaths now I know this

148
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,630
may seem a bit repetitive but I'm just

149
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,980
trying to make sure that you understand

150
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,300
the point of this now as you can see

151
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,980
I've died once I do it again I've died

152
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,830
two times and I couldn't die again for

153
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,280
whoops I can die no I've got it there we

154
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:57,550
go

155
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:00,570
I can die again for the third time now I

156
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:04,540
hope this makes sense but yeah and the

157
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,910
actually will do it this video you guys

158
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,440
seem to like longer videos so we'll do

159
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,800
this one so now we can do that actually

160
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,510
nest now I do I do apologize I will

161
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,800
leave that to the next video because it

162
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,170
is gonna be a little longer but yeah I

163
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,060
hope you guys learn something I hope you

164
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,280
understood some some stuff but yeah

165
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,320
that's how we can execute information on

166
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,620
the player now retrieving a specific

167
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,210
player on the server is different which

168
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,890
is why we haven't gone into the server

169
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,710
side yet but for the client you can get

170
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,170
the the client player which is the the

171
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,670
person's game who it is you can get

172
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,380
their client their player

173
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,210
and we store it in the variable player

174
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,250
which is our reference to it and then we

175
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,950
call on that variable the function depth

176
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,450
which will return the number of deaths

177
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,670
that players had then we simply go ahead

178
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,080
and we print that out so I hope that

179
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,450
makes sense to you in the next video

180
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,850
we'll go ahead and we'll do a little bit

181
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,290
more complicated again and I do

00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,300
fine complexity but to begin with for
