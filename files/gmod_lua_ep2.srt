00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,730
hello everybody and welcome to part two

2
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,119
in this gmod people do it saucers now in

3
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,400
this video again we're not gonna be

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,140
learning too much but what we will be

5
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,860
doing is we will be showing you how to

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,689
basically run a script inside of Garry's

7
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:29,810
Mod so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go

8
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,860
ahead and I will open up sublime I'm

9
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,920
gonna go to file new file just like

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,879
normal

11
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:40,280
remember based on whichever text editor

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,900
you're using this may be different but

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,329
normally it's the same for all I'm just

14
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:45,739
gonna go ahead and hit ctrl s to save

15
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:51,800
I'm then gonna go over to where garry's

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,270
mod is installed steam library steam

17
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,270
apps common Garry's Mod then go to

18
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,180
Garry's Mod again and then go ahead and

19
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:04,610
go into newer sorry and then here is

20
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:05,899
where you're gonna want to save it so

21
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,759
for example I'm just gonna save this as

22
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:11,270
test dot lower now remember it's got to

23
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,070
be a Lua file so if we go ahead and say

24
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,720
that now you can get the gmod low Alexa

25
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,349
which is done by F jpg I remember his

26
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:23,270
name there will be a link in the

27
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,500
description to that that's if you're

28
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,119
using sublime but I know there is also

29
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,240
one for Adam and notepad plus plus so if

30
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,800
you using even one of those it will also

31
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,990
work now in here we're gonna write our

32
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,520
script I was good it's gonna be very

33
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,459
simple it's just gonna simply be print

34
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:40,039
hello world just like that now you'll

35
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:42,020
notice how we don't have the i/o dot

36
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,020
read on here which we did in my lure

37
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,880
tutorial series and that's because

38
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,830
Garry's Mod is is running this as the

39
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,330
environment meaning if our script gets

40
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,860
to the end of the code Garry's Mod it's

41
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,720
still gonna be running so it doesn't

42
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,140
close so IO doc read it's not needed

43
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,910
anymore just simply print hello world so

44
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,099
let's then go into a gmod will then

45
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:03,410
start up a single-player game and once

46
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,030
we're in the game there we go we're

47
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,080
gonna go ahead and we're gonna go into

48
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,179
our console I'm will type Lua and the

49
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:11,360
score open open script and there's

50
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,879
called CL and then you simply start type

51
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,379
in the name of your script in this case

52
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:17,180
ours was test a lure we do that we hit

53
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,130
enter and as you can see it says it's

54
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,540
running the script and then it says

55
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,010
hello world so the first thing you'll

56
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,780
notice is that this is now our

57
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,660
so with before we had the e terminal on

58
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,640
Windows this is now our console so yeah

59
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,650
that's pretty much that we can also do

60
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,200
Lua underscore open scripts and instead

61
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,930
of doing an underscore CL we just simply

62
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,640
type open script and type of test and as

63
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,260
you can see it did the exact same except

64
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,390
this time our text was in blue and if

65
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,680
you remember our client and server

66
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,970
tutorial I said the orange was client

67
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,700
and blue was the server so when we went

68
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,050
on our client you'll notice how the text

69
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,030
is orange moving around on the server

70
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,920
our text is blue and as I've already

71
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,980
stated in that video there is a client

72
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,420
and server even though I'm on single

73
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,880
player there is basically a server with

74
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,370
one slot for you to join that is not

75
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,170
hosted on the internet but on your local

76
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,810
game so again there is still a client on

77
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,819
the server now I hope that really makes

78
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,560
sense to you again I know this is

79
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,330
another short video but the idea of this

80
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,560
video is just to give you a name

81
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,489
explanation on how we can go ahead and

82
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:24,680
write and execute scripts now one thing

83
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,410
to know is that for now we're gonna be

84
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,360
doing all of our work inside of that Lua

85
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,040
folder that I told you to save in now

86
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,269
once we obviously get a bit further on

87
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:36,290
we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna

88
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,910
convert those into add-ons rather than

89
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,470
having to place them into the newer

90
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,260
folder but yeah I hope you learned

91
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,030
something and again I do apologize for

92
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,489
it be in such a short video these are

93
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:48,049
just designed to give you the

94
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:49,880
introductory of what we need to get

95
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,530
started so again if you have any

96
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,180
questions leave a comment I hope you

97
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,739
learned something I hope you enjoyed

98
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:57,049
watching and I'll see you in the next

99
00:03:57,049 --> 00:03:59,260
video

100
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,940
you
