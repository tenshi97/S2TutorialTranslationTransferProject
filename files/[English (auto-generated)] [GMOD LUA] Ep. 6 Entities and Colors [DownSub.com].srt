00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,100
hello everybody and welcome to part 6

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,279
now industry module stories now if you

3
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:17,840
remember in the previous video we

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,240
learned about how we can get a reference

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,890
to the local player and how we can run

6
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,040
functions on those players now we can

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,600
also do the same for entities so now

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,490
we'll go ahead and we'll bring up our

9
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,830
Garry's Mod and we'll also bring up our

10
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:38,930
sublime now if you remember in the

11
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,269
previous tutorial we could do local

12
00:00:41,269 --> 00:00:43,519
player and that would be our reference

13
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:46,610
to the local play all right well we can

14
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:50,210
do end stuff get all and that would give

15
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,890
us a table and if you don't know what a

16
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,420
table is go back and check previous

17
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,260
videos it would give us a table of every

18
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,629
single entity that exists currently in

19
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:01,909
the world now this will include players

20
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:05,630
props map objects you know all kind of

21
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,080
things like that but how is that useful

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,880
well we'll go ahead and I'm gonna write

23
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,880
a quick script now this wouldn't work in

24
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,710
theory but I'll show you it real quick

25
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,320
so what we can do is we can make a

26
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,539
variable and call it entities I am and

27
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,729
we can certainly go to and stock get

28
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:25,729
four now that's gonna get a list of our

29
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:28,070
table sorry of all of the entities that

30
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,439
exist on the server now what we can do

31
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,030
is if you remember in our other videos

32
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,159
about loops we can simply use for

33
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,530
kayvyun pairs to loop over that and

34
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,329
we're gonna loop over the table entities

35
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:39,920
because remember tenth entities is a

36
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,159
table of data from from the end stock at

37
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,600
all function so again if you don't know

38
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,700
what kV and paise means go back and

39
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,590
check my lure tutorial series I can't

40
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,060
remember the exact number I think it's

41
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,759
number four and I cover tables there and

42
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:53,960
if you check the other one there will be

43
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,960
a tutorial to on how to do loops like

44
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,999
this but anyway then what we can do is

45
00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:01,640
we can go like yeah bring up the the

46
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,439
gmod wiki real quick over here and yeah

47
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:08,350
we can go ahead and we can search now

48
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:13,160
set color okay and as you can see here

49
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,870
it says entity : set color so if you

50
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,550
remember before when we seen a function

51
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,989
it says player : set color now player is

52
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:23,390
because it wanted player data while in

53
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,220
case we're gonna use it on an entity it

54
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,170
wants an entity data and you'll see that

55
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,640
it's gonna ask for a table of color I'll

56
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,930
explain that in a minute but what we can

57
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,360
do is V is gonna be the value in that

58
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,010
table which in this case will be the

59
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,450
current entity that we've looped over

60
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,450
and I'm gonna call : set color because I

61
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,120
can call set color on an entity now up

62
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,000
here I make a local variable call it C

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,080
which is short for color and we can

64
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,670
assign it a color the way how we can do

65
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,270
that is we type the function color and

66
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:54,410
then we type in some parameters now in

67
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,200
this case we'll do 255 255 255 that's

68
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,870
gonna be white now if you're not too

69
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,120
sure if I quickly open up photoshop over

70
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,620
here once it loads I do apologize there

71
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,300
we go if you're unsure if you just go

72
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,920
into well that was like it if you just

73
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,180
go into Photoshop you could make any

74
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,700
color you want over here right and then

75
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,440
as you can see here there is an Archie

76
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,780
and a B value all right now are being

77
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,390
red green G being queen and BB and blue

78
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,640
now this year primary colors I'm with

79
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,989
these you can make any color you could

80
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:27,799
possibly imagine

81
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:30,410
so let's say we wanted a red we could go

82
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,480
red and as you can see it red is 255

83
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,750
green is 0 blue is 0 so we can use that

84
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,549
so let's say I want to make the color

85
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:41,150
red I could do to 5500 right so then I

86
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,890
create that color I stored in C and then

87
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,220
the color I set it to is whoops is C now

88
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,410
the reason why I do this is because as

89
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,810
you can see here it asks for a color now

90
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,880
I know it asked for a table but by table

91
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,110
it means this color property and there

92
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,540
we have it so that's that now we go

93
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,829
ahead and we set its color so let's go

94
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:04,190
let's go in-game let's spawn in a few

95
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:07,970
props real quick just like this and as

96
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,320
you can see we now have a nice line of

97
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,959
props now I'm gonna go lure underscore

98
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:13,910
open script CL and I'm gonna open up our

99
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,459
test script and now as you can see some

100
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:17,870
of them changed back to white I'll

101
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,668
explain why in a minute but as you can

102
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:21,738
see pretty much all of them turn red and

103
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:23,810
this includes map entities too so you

104
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,610
can see how they you could have the

105
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,360
lights have gone and also if I go ahead

106
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,280
and no clip now over into the color room

107
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,560
oh not that kind of um didn't update my

108
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,930
bad but you can see how they change and

109
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,280
as you can see over time they

110
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,020
actually changed back to the original

111
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,730
color if I run it again they change but

112
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,080
soon as I interact with them they go

113
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,880
back to the normal color now

114
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,590
I'll quickly give you an explanation of

115
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,540
why this is and this is because set

116
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,220
color even though it can be called on

117
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,200
client and server it should only be

118
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,700
called on the server and what it'll do

119
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,830
is it'll set some set of props color to

120
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,780
that color set a props color to that

121
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,720
color yes sorry my bad now the problem

122
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,880
is is we're doing this client-side on

123
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,560
the client we're changing it only for

124
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,510
our game not the actual service so it

125
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,700
only visually looks different for us not

126
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,010
anybody else on the server and as soon

127
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,620
as a prop updates such as moving or gets

128
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,960
replaced or anything changes on it the

129
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,760
server then reuptake the client with the

130
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,380
new information that includes the color

131
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,880
so the color goes back to its original

132
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,070
color as soon as it's interacted or

133
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,040
moved so I hope that makes sense so

134
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,860
that's how we can run functions on an

135
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,590
entity now I know this doesn't seem like

136
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,150
much all we did is change your color of

137
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,470
an entity that doesn't even work

138
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,889
correctly but in the next video we're

139
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:39,710
gonna be showing you or I'm gonna be

140
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,950
showing you how we can execute

141
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,580
server-side scripts we're gonna be

142
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,380
moving slightly over to the server we're

143
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,030
still mainly focused on the client right

144
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,220
now but we can show you some stuff on

145
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,960
the server now the reason why this is is

146
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,010
because if we go ahead and look at these

147
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,870
as you can see the majority of the the

148
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,720
cool ones if you go to the wiki yourself

149
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,690
a server only functions so we gotta get

150
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,979
our script running on the server so yeah

151
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:06,200
so I'll see you in the next video I hope

152
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,729
you learned something the next video

153
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:09,380
should be pretty soon if you have any

154
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,640
questions feel free to leave a comment

155
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,650
and I'll I'll see you in the next video

156
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,800
you
